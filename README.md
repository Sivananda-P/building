## Project Description

A totally unnecessary but highly entertaining simulator that predicts your "fall fate" based on a few questions about building height, hospital proximity, and landing surface — complete with over-the-top animations and ridiculous death scenarios.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)

People go through life without knowing what hilarious way they would fall and perish (or survive). This uncertainty causes deep unrest among thrill-seekers and meme lovers.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)

We built a cartoonish web app that uses unscientific fall physics and random humor to decide your fate. Whether you bounce off a mattress, get flattened like a dosa, or crash a wedding, we’ve got you covered.
