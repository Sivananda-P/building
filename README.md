DEATH FALL SIMULATOR

 Project Description: A totally unnecessary but highly entertaining simulator that predicts your “fall
 fate” based on a few questions about building height, hospital proximity, and landing surface —
 complete with over-the-top animations and ridiculous death scenarios.
 The Problem (that doesn't exist): People go through life without knowing what hilarious way they
 would fall and perish (or survive). This uncertainty causes deep unrest among thrill-seekers and
 meme lovers.
 The Solution (that nobody asked for): We built a cartoonish web app that uses unscientific fall
 physics and random humor to decide your fate. Whether you bounce off a mattress, get flattened
 like a dosa, or crash a wedding, we’ve got you covered.
